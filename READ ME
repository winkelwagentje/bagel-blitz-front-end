REQUIREMENTS TO RUN:
To run the program you need atleast Python 3.10. 

In addition the program requires the following libraries:
- enumerate
- copy
- pyglet

The first two should be included in the standard library.

To check if pyglet is installed:
Type: pip list
Or type: py -m pip list

To install pyglet:
Type: pip install Pyglet
Or type: py -m pip install Pyglet

HOW TO RUN:
You could run the shortcut in the starting directory named 'main-executable'.
Alternatively you could run main.py in the compiler of your choosing. 

Running the executable could result in the pause-button's sprite dissapearing. This
still needs to be fixed switching between python 3.10 and 3.11 seems to work.

WHAT SHOULD BE GRADED:
The files written by us are:
- board.py
- button.py
- clock.py
- enumerators.py
- game.py
- GUI_handler.py
- main.py
- mouse_handler.py
- piece.py
- square.py

In addition the contents of the 'images' folder was made by us.
